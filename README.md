# Beecrowd Problem Solutions

Welcome to the **Beecrowd Problem Solutions** repository! This repository contains my solutions to various problems from the [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br) platform. Beecrowd is an online judge system that offers a wide range of algorithmic challenges to help programmers practice and improve their coding skills.

## 📝 About
This repository is organized by problem categories and difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive set of solved problems for learning and reference. Each problem includes my code implementation and a brief explanation of the solution approach, where necessary.

Whether you are a beginner looking to practice fundamental programming concepts or an advanced coder tackling complex algorithmic challenges, this repository offers something for everyone.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

/problems ├── Beginner ├── Ad-Hoc ├── Strings ├── Mathematics ├── Graph ├── Geometry └── Data Structures

Each category contains subfolders for different difficulty levels and individual problem files with their respective solutions. Inside each category, problems are named according to their Beecrowd problem ID and a short description for easy navigation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Platform**: Beecrowd
- **Tools**:
